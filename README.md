# Grimm-Form

This is a program that stores car maintenance history.
It had a save mode which overwrites the file so it can be edited.
It has a append mode so that you can add data to an existing file.
This is a two window program so you can write and look back at the previous version.
The read side updates every time there is new data appended.
